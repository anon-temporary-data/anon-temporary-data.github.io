This site is dedicated the ANON Dataset, a large-scale, open-source symbolic dataset comprising expressive, improvised drum performances crowd-sourced from a pool of individuals with varying levels of musical expertise. 

This dataset consists of 6,035 unique tapped sequences performed by 3,184 participants. Originating from an interactive installation, participants were invited to use a provided MIDI pad to tap along to a multi-voice drum pattern in a genre and tempo of their choosing. By providing minimal instructions, this task serves as an examination of how participants freely improvise alongside another rhythm.
