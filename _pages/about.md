This site is dedicated to the ANON Dataset, a crowd-sourced expressive symbolic dataset consisting of 6,035 improvised tapped sequences performed by 3,184 participants with varying levels of musical expertise. Originating from an interactive installation at the arts center ANON, participants were invited to use a provided MIDI pad to tap along to a multi-voice drum pattern in a genre and tempo of their choosing. By providing minimal instructions, this dataset serves as an examination of how participants freely improvise alongside another rhythm.

Each sample contains expressive timing and dynamics information and is annotated with the participantâ€™s self-reported level of musical expertise, the genre of the selected pattern, the chosen tempo, the total duration to complete the activity, and a user-rating for their performance and how much they enjoyed the exhibit. The source drum patterns which the participants improvised alongside were patterns in the 4/4 metric, selected from a large in-house MIDI collection comprised of several open-source and proprietary MIDI collections. The MIDI files in this collection were divided into 10 genres: Afrobeat, Afrocuban, Bossanova, Disco, Electronic, Funk, Hiphop, Jazz, Rock, and Soul.

We anticipate that this dataset can promote further research in the following areas:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Advancing the development of more nuanced generative models capable of accommodating a range of skill levels.
    \item Facilitating music education studies focused on music understanding and rhythm expertise.
    \item Evaluating the proficiency, diversity, and creativity with which humans improvise rhythms.
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, the collection of data in this study adhered to rigorous ethical standards. The installation was crafted so that prior to starting the activity, participants were explicitly notified that we would later request their permission to store the data they generate while interacting with the exhibit. In addition to ensuring explicit consent from participants, we did not collect any personal or demographic information. Moreover, as stewards of this dataset, we are committed to employing the collected data solely for academic research purposes, ensuring that it is used in a manner consistent with what was communicated to participants.
